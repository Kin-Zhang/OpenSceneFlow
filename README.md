Floxels re-implementation now....

Please do not run it yet, still under debugging... with Floxels author to make sure the re-implementation is correct.

Run command, I think I need clean up the `num_frames` and `flow_num` logic later... It could be confusing except for me:

```bash
# for symmetric input 5 frames: 
python eval.py model=floxels dataset_path=/home/ssd/qingwen/data/av2/h5py/demo num_frames=4 flow_num=2

# for 7 frames:
python eval.py model=floxels dataset_path=/home/ssd/qingwen/data/av2/h5py/demo num_frames=5 flow_num=3

# for 13 frames
python eval.py model=floxels dataset_path=/home/ssd/qingwen/data/av2/h5py/demo num_frames=8 flow_num=6
```

💡: Want to learn how to add your own network in this structure? Check [Contribute section](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-method) and know more about the code. Fee free to pull request and your bibtex [here](#cite-us).

## 0. Installation

There are two ways to install the codebase: directly on your [local machine](#environment-setup) or in a [Docker container](#docker-recommended-for-isolation).

### Environment Setup

We use conda to manage the environment, you can install it follow [here](assets/README.md#system). Then create the base environment with the following command [5~15 minutes]:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/KTH-RPL/OpenSceneFlow.git
cd OpenSceneFlow && conda env create -f environment.yaml

# You may need export your LD_LIBRARY_PATH with env lib
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/kin/mambaforge/lib
```
We also provide [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), please check usage through [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

### Docker (Recommended for Isolation)

You always can choose [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) which isolated environment and free yourself from installation. Pull the pre-built Docker image or build manually.

```bash
# option 1: pull from docker hub
docker pull zhangkin/opensf

# run container
docker run -it --net=host --gpus all -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm -v /home/kin/data:/home/kin/data --name opensf zhangkin/opensf /bin/zsh

# and better to read your own gpu device info to compile the cuda extension again:
cd /home/kin/workspace/OpenSceneFlow && git pull
cd /home/kin/workspace/OpenSceneFlow/assets/cuda/mmcv && /opt/conda/envs/opensf/bin/python ./setup.py install
cd /home/kin/workspace/OpenSceneFlow/assets/cuda/chamfer3D && /opt/conda/envs/opensf/bin/python ./setup.py install
cd /home/kin/workspace/OpenSceneFlow
conda activate opensf
```

If you prefer to build the Docker image by yourself, Check [build-docker-image](assets/README.md#build-docker-image) section for more details.

## 1. Data Preparation

Refer to [dataprocess/README.md](dataprocess/README.md) for dataset download instructions. Currently, we support [**Argoverse 2**](https://www.argoverse.org/av2.html), [**Waymo**](https://waymo.com/open/), [**nuScenes**](https://www.nuscenes.org/), [**MAN-TruckScene**](https://github.com/TUMFTM/truckscenes-devkit), [**ZOD**](https://github.com/zenseact/zod) and **custom datasets** (more datasets will be added in the future). 

After downloading, convert the raw data to `.h5` format for easy training, evaluation, and visualization. Follow the steps in [dataprocess/README.md#process](dataprocess/README.md#process). 

For a quick start, use our **mini processed dataset**, which includes one scene in `train` and `val`. It is pre-converted to `.h5` format with label data ([HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/kin-zhang/OpenSceneFlow/resolve/main/demo-data-v2.zip)).


```bash
# around 1.3G
wget https://huggingface.co/kin-zhang/OpenSceneFlow/resolve/main/demo-data-v2.zip
unzip demo-data-v2.zip -d /home/kin/data/av2/h5py
```

Once extracted, you can directly use this dataset to run the [training script](#2-quick-start) without further processing.

## 2. Quick Start

Some tips before running the code:
* Don't forget to active Python environment before running the code. 
* If you want to use [wandb](wandb.ai), replace all `entity="kth-rpl",` to your own entity otherwise tensorboard will be used locally.
* Set correct data path by passing the config, e.g. `train_data=/home/kin/data/av2/h5py/demo/train val_data=/home/kin/data/av2/h5py/demo/val`.

And free yourself from trainning, you can download the pretrained weight from [**HuggingFace - OpenSceneFlow**](https://huggingface.co/kin-zhang/OpenSceneFlow) and we provided the detail `wget` command in each model section. For optimization-based method, it's train-free so you can directly run with [3. Evaluation](#3-evaluation) (check more in the evaluation section).

```bash
conda activate opensf
```

### Supervised Training

#### DeltaFlow

Train DeltaFlow with the leaderboard submit config. [Runtime: Around 18 hours in 10x RTX 3080 GPUs.]

```

### Feed-Forward Self-Supervised Model Training

Train Feed-forward SSL methods (e.g. SeFlow/SeFlow++/VoteFlow etc), we needed to:
1) process auto-label process for training. Check [dataprocess/README.md#self-supervised-process](dataprocess/README.md#self-supervised-process) for more details. We provide these inside the demo dataset already.
2) specify the loss function, we set the config here for our best model in the leaderboard.

#### SeFlow

```bash
# [Runtime: Around 11 hours in 4x A100 GPUs.]
python train.py model=deflow optimizer.lr=2e-4 epochs=9 batch_size=16 loss_fn=seflowLoss +ssl_label=seflow_auto "+add_seloss={chamfer_dis: 1.0, static_flow_loss: 1.0, dynamic_chamfer_dis: 1.0, cluster_based_pc0pc1: 1.0}" "model.target.num_iters=2"

# Pretrained weight can be downloaded through:
wget https://huggingface.co/kin-zhang/OpenSceneFlow/resolve/main/seflow_best.ckpt
```

#### VoteFLow

python train.py model=deflowpp save_top_model=3 val_every=3 voxel_size="[0.2, 0.2, 6]" point_cloud_range="[-51.2, -51.2, -3, 51.2, 51.2, 3]" num_workers=16 epochs=9 optimizer.lr=2e-4 +optimizer.scheduler.name=StepLR "+add_seloss={chamfer_dis: 1.0, static_flow_loss: 1.0, dynamic_chamfer_dis: 1.0, cluster_based_pc0pc1: 1.0}" +ssl_label=seflowpp_auto loss_fn=seflowppLoss num_frames=3 batch_size=4

# Pretrained weight can be downloaded through:
wget https://huggingface.co/kin-zhang/OpenSceneFlow/resolve/main/seflowpp_best.ckpt
```


### Optimization-based Unsupervised Methods

For all optimization-based methods, you can directly run `eval.py`/`save.py` to get the result without training, while the running might take really long time, maybe tmux for run it. For multi-program running, the master port can be set through `+master_port=12346`.

```bash
# you can change another model by passing model name.
python eval.py model=fastnsf

# or save the result directly
python save.py model=fastnsf
```


## 3. Evaluation

You can view Wandb dashboard for the training and evaluation results or upload result to online leaderboard. 
<!-- Three-way EPE and Dynamic Bucket-normalized are evaluated within a 70x70m range (followed Argoverse 2 online leaderboard). No ground points are considered in the evaluation. -->

Since in training, we save all hyper-parameters and model checkpoints, the only thing you need to do is to specify the checkpoint path. Remember to set the data path correctly also.

```bash
# (feed-forward): load ckpt and run it, it will directly prints all metric
python eval.py checkpoint=/home/kin/seflow_best.ckpt data_mode=val

# (optimization-based): it might need take really long time, maybe tmux for run it.
python eval.py model=nsfp +master_port=12344 # change diff port if you want to have multiple runners.

# it will output the av2_submit.zip or av2_submit_v2.zip for you to submit to leaderboard
python eval.py checkpoint=/home/kin/seflow_best.ckpt data_mode=test leaderboard_version=1
python eval.py checkpoint=/home/kin/seflow_best.ckpt data_mode=test leaderboard_version=2
```

### **📊 Range-Wise Metric (New!)**
In [SSF paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17821), we introduce a new distance-based evaluation metric for scene flow estimation. Below is an example output for SSF with point_cloud_range to 204.8m and voxel_size=0.2m. Check more long-range result in [SSF paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17821).

| Distance  | Static    | Dynamic  | NumPointsStatic | NumPointsDynamic |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| 0-35      | 0.00836  | 0.11546  | 3.33e+08        | 1.57e+07         |
| 35-50     | 0.00910  | 0.16805  | 4.40e+07        | 703125           |

| **Mean**  | 0.01259  | 0.20693  | NaN             | NaN              |


### Submit result to public leaderboard
To submit your result to the public Leaderboard, if you select `data_mode=test`, it should be a zip file for you to submit to the leaderboard.
Note: The leaderboard result in DeFlow&SeFlow main paper is [version 1](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2010/evaluation), as [version 2](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2210/overview) is updated after DeFlow&SeFlow.

```bash
# since the env may conflict we set new on deflow, we directly create new one:
conda create -n py37 python=3.7
conda activate py37
pip install "evalai"

# Step 2: login in eval and register your team
evalai set-token <your token>

# Step 3: Copy the command pop above and submit to leaderboard
evalai challenge 2010 phase 4018 submit --file av2_submit.zip --large --private
evalai challenge 2210 phase 4396 submit --file av2_submit_v2.zip --large --private
```

## 4. Visualization

We provide a script to visualize the results of the model also. You can specify the checkpoint path and the data path to visualize the results. The step is quite similar to evaluation.

```bash
# (feed-forward): load ckpt
python save.py checkpoint=/home/kin/seflow_best.ckpt dataset_path=/home/kin/data/av2/preprocess_v2/sensor/vis
# (optimization-based): change another model by passing model name.
python eval.py model=nsfp dataset_path=/home/kin/data/av2/h5py/demo/val

# The output of above command will be like:
Model: DeFlow, Checkpoint from: /home/kin/model_zoo/v2/seflow_best.ckpt
We already write the flow_est into the dataset, please run following commend to visualize the flow. Copy and paste it to your terminal:
python tools/visualization.py --res_name 'seflow_best' --data_dir /home/kin/data/av2/preprocess_v2/sensor/vis
Enjoy! ^v^ ------ 

# Then run the command in the terminal:
python tools/visualization.py --res_name 'seflow_best' --data_dir /home/kin/data/av2/preprocess_v2/sensor/vis
```

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f031d1a2-2d2f-4947-a01f-834ed1c146e6

For exporting easy comparsion with ground truth and other methods, we also provided multi-visulization open3d window:
```bash
python tools/visualization.py --mode mul --res_name "['flow', 'seflow_best']" --data_dir /home/kin/data/av2/preprocess_v2/sensor/vis
```

Or another way to interact with [rerun](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun) but please only vis scene by scene, not all at once.

```bash
python tools/visualization_rerun.py --data_dir /home/kin/data/av2/h5py/demo/train --res_name "['flow', 'deflow']"
```
